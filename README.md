# A high performance Neurevolution algorithm for robotic manipulator control
This repository contains the work developed by Simone Morettini and Manuel Fraile on the course: Il2202 - Research Methodology and Scientific Writing.

The aim of this course is to produce a research paper as a training or previous step for the Master's Thesis. In our case, we decide to develop a novel technique for controlling a robotic manipulator.
